jQuery Practical Questions:  
1. Create a simple HTML form with fields for name, email, and a submit button. Field name 
and  email should have relevant validation. Use jQuery to prevent the form from submitting 
when  the submit button is clicked and instead display an alert with the form data.  
2. Create an HTML page that includes two dropdown menus (combos): one for selecting states 
and  another for displaying cities. When the user selects a state from the primary combo, the  
secondary combo (cities) should dynamically update to display cities relevant to the selected  
state.  
3. Write jQuery code to toggle the visibility of a div element when a button is clicked. The div  
should start as hidden, and clicking the button should alternate between showing and hiding 
it. 
4. Create a basic image slider using jQuery. Users should be able to click "Next" and "Previous"  
buttons to navigate between a series of images displayed on a webpage.  
5. Implement a simple client-side validation using jQuery. Check if a text input field is empty when  
a form is submitted. If it's empty, display an error message next to the input field.
